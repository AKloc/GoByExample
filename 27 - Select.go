Goâ€™s select lets you wait on multiple channel operations.
Combining goroutines and channels with select is a powerful feature of Go.

// Looks like a switch, but isn't! Basically if you put a channel receive in
//   it will evaluate everything and wait for the channels to receive before
//	 continuing.

// SELECT: Only used with channels, can choose multiple valid options as they
//   roll in.
// SWITCH: Only used with concrete types. Always go in sequence.
